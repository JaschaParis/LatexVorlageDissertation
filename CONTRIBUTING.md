## File Names

### LaTeX Files

LaTeX related files (`*.tex`, `*.sty`, `*.bbx`, `*.cbx`) are named in the `all-lowercase` style with hyphen as word separator. The names only contain alphanumeric ASCII characters as **a-z**, **0-9** and **-**. For further explanation please read [this article](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/12174/naming-latex-files-best-practice) on Stack Tex Exchange.
